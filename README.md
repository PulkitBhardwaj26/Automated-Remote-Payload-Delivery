# Automated-Remote-Payload-Delivery

Project Overview
This project was designed to study web-based payload delivery mechanisms and endpoint protection systems in a controlled, sandboxed environment. The goal was to understand how executables can be automatically delivered through web interactions and how modern systems defend against such techniques.

Key Components
Custom Web Server: A Python-based server that automatically delivers executables when clients interact with the hosted webpage.

Quasar RAT Integration: Used the open-source Quasar Remote Administration Tool for testing remote access behavior (strictly in a personal sandboxed environment).

Quasar RAT GitHub: https://github.com/quasar/Quasar

Defense Evaluation: Analyzed how browser-level protections and endpoint systems intercept unsolicited executable downloads.

Important Notes
This project was conducted only on personal devices in an isolated environment.

The research was performed strictly for educational purposes in cybersecurity.

No real-world systems or unauthorized devices were targeted.

Research Findings
Successfully demonstrated automated payload delivery techniques and gained practical insights into:

Web-based file distribution methods

Endpoint protection mechanisms

Browser download protection systems

This project served as a controlled experiment to better understand attack vectors and improve defensive strategies.
